**Godot** is an open source game engine. In this repository I made an artificial intelligence library and implemented some use cases.

# 1. Simple perceptron
Here I implemented a simple perceptron, that has the role of doing linear separation of points based on a given function `y=mx+b`.

# 2. Multilayer perceptron
The first project scaled to n perceptrons, and now is a fully funcional neutral network with 3 layers, that can be trained and used for predictions.
In this project I aproximated the XOR operator.

# 3. Matrix math
This is the barebone library of matrix operations. It contains a `Matrix class` with all the basic operations (both scalar and matrix wise) and a `MatrixOperator class` that contains static function for the matrices.

# 4. Color predictor
This is a program that predicts weather a color should be white or black, given the background color.
